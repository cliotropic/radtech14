Twitter archive from Radcliffe Workshop on Technology & Archival Processing, April 3-4, 2014

For more information on the workshop, see <http://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/exploratory-seminars/2014-technology-and-archival-processing>. 

This is a rough cut of tweets recorded from the event; tweets may be repeated across multiple files, because my intention was to take a rough snapshot.


## Ideas for readers

* If you're so inclined, feel free to fork this repository, de-duplicate the tweets, and make a pull request. 
* I could use a simple csv-to-html script contribution, if you have one lying around.
